# Project Name

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

started by going trough the steps in the project brief one step at a time and trying to only focus on one ting at a time. When getting stuck i asked for help with the problem and then kept workng on next step. used a lot of console log to try and understand when different funktions were invoked and what they actualy do. 
if i had more time i would like to change styling and the theme of the game. would also like to make the already used questions to dissapear and set a max amount of guesses.
